What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.
- Arcade library in Python and the random library in python.

What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.
- User interface - cards, and the math for your hand.
- Base game of Blackjack with just one player.

What is your timeline? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.
